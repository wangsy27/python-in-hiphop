
不需要苍白言语
一字一句拉开间距
Oh yeah, but you already know what I’m about to say
其实都难以言喻
以怎样的速率前去
Oh yeah, thought I would but I ain’t here to play
Said I could
Let you in but I hate it when you see through me
Got you good
That night when I was acting unruly
Hold me close
Do me do me you don’t have to do me properly
Let me know
通往你灵魂最深处最蜿蜒的路径

Yeah you got me riding riding riding riding like crazy
持续感觉你的气息温度直到满足我的我的我的味蕾
与你一路飞驰紧握着方向盘
表盘指针在我脑海里不停转
Going like a Mercedes Got me riding like crazy

撕扯着陌生面具
将所剩的熟悉减去
Oh yeah, I gotta know you there ain’t no other way
How you feel
扼住咽喉侵入流淌在这瞬息里
Make it real
泡沫般的幻象相拥彼此共呼吸
Yeah you got me riding riding riding riding like crazy
持续感觉你的气息温度直到满足我的我的我的味蕾
与你一路飞驰紧握着方向盘
表盘指针在我脑海里不停转
Going like a Mercedes got me riding like crazy

I wanna know you body
Keep on climbing with me
I wanna know your body

I wanna know you body
Keep on climbing with me
I wanna know your body

Yeah you got me riding riding riding riding like crazy
持续感觉你的气息温度直到满足我的我的我的味蕾
与你一路飞驰紧握着方向盘
表盘指针在我脑海里不停转
Going like a Mercedes Got me riding like crazy

Yeah you got me riding riding riding riding like crazy
持续感觉你的气息温度直到满足我的我的我的味蕾
与你一路飞驰紧握着方向盘
表盘指针在我脑海里不停转
