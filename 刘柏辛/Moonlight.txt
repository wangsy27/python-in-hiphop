Wish I could’ve felt your heart
Feel the way you breathe at night
Especially when you’re down just feel like crying
Wish I could’ve been there now
Stand behind you through your fight
But we were never close enough for that
So I watch from miles away
Like a heart could got my brain
Cuz I never lose my faith that one day
You'll come back
Sit with me again so high
Drink all night laugh all night
Sing like this time the sun rise
Yeah, Yeah
Say goodbye to our old life
Watch the people just walk back
You kiss me hard in the moonlight
Yeah, Yeah
Oh maybe one day
Wish I could ya see you now
Take your hand or smile somehow
Especially cuz you’re down missed out the crying
You’re now like fireflies
Even when so far above
Cuz we were never close enough like that
So I watch from miles away
Like a heart could got my brain
Cuz I never lose my faith that one day
You'll come back
Sit with me again so high
Drink all night laugh all night
Sing like this time the sun rise
Yeah, Yeah
Say goodbye to our old life
Watch the people just walk back
You kiss me hard in the moonlight
Yeah, Yeah
Oh maybe one day
Oh maybe one day
