
他从不将姿态放低
目中无人却彬彬有礼

深邃的眼像座迷宫
漩涡流向了无底洞

别再怀疑
他在玩一个戏法

眼花缭乱的谜
飘不散地伴着任由风儿吹

I just want to be loved
guess we’re bound to be lost
I could wait another night
Just to take another bite on you
最后你不在 那我睡了别再来了吧

I just want to be loved
guess we’re bound to be lost
I could wait another night
Just to take another bite on you
最后你不在 那我睡了别再来了吧

Then wear the gold hat, like it would move me
If you can bounce high, bounce for me in one two, three

夏日玫瑰盛开
花瓣飞
我不会再等待
for a day

The girl really worth having won’t wait for anybody
The girl really worth having won’t wait for anybody

I just want to be loved
guess we’re bound to be lost
I could wait another night
Just to take another bite on you
最后你不在 那我睡了别再来了吧
