
跳动放肆的血液冲上脉络
嗅到新鲜气味第一夜要找快活
多巴胺充斥控制大脑没法摆脱
默契和温柔都在瞬间无度挥霍
就让这时间放慢停格甚至倒流
昏暗中绚丽消耗直到毫无保留
营造气氛 控制多变气温
赢得积分 不愿多败一分
Good girls gone bad
When they give their hearts way too fast
Girls gone bad
When they learned that feelings won’t last
You gotta let them know let them know they are different
Aren’t like any other girls that you’ve been with
Good girls gone bad
汽水和Mentos拥吻爆炸化学反应
体温触碰到烟火燃放时间暂停
刹那间回到原始抛开理性感性
彻夜未眠燃放着眼球里的繁星
The night is still young
I’ve been waiting for this moment for so long
Tell me if I'm the girl that you’ve always wanted
I freestyle the topline with your drums and finesse a song
Good girls gone bad
When they give their hearts way too fast
Girls gone bad
When they learned that feelings won’t last
You gotta let them know let them know they are different
Aren’t like any other girls that you’ve been with
Good girls go bad
Everybody knows
They’ll love you more when you hold them really close (really close)
Everybody knows
They’ll love you more when you hold them really close (really close)
Good girls gone bad
Good girls gone bad
Good girls gone bad
When they give their hearts way too fast
Girls gone bad
When they learned that feelings won’t last
You gotta let them know let them know they are different
Aren’t like any other girls that you’ve been with
Good girls gone bad
When they learned that feelings won’t last
