
Never was a quitter so I ride on
19, more problems
Money callin' blowing up my iPhone
I'm the one to keep your eyes on
他们没想到的时机开工
气流旋转超速二十级的台风
地球奥秘没時間一个个猜中
宇航员会探索未知的外太空
一飞冲天的高度 大气层外失重
闭上眼睛我从来 没做过白日梦
闭上眼睛我从来 只想往外直冲
有一天黄皮肤也能踏进白宫
All the bygones they can be the bygones
Surrounded by fear turn the lights on
I ain't got no option already been shut down
软弱的每一面都要被光芒遮挡
I’m going down for real, down for real
I can’t sleep I can’t sleep
Staying up all night
Wishing my life was not my life
I’m going down for real, down for real
Thought I gotta graduate but college ain't a place for me
It's the choice I had to make cuz I got somewhere else to be
他们不想让我累了 不想让我背着
不想让我被焦虑击碎 含着化了捧着不想让我飞了
Done with finals, I’mma run back to a place called home
Long nights 16 hours flight across the time zones
Things changed when I ain’t here,
All the noises that  I  can’t hear
Stepping in the house shouting mama I’m home
But she moved out from the master bedroom
Don't judge me by my 3.9 report card
Please do that when I'm swervin' on my sports car
When I landed JFK my family fell  apart
But I come home and tell them how New York was
I’m going down for real, down for real
I can’t sleep I can’t sleep
Staying up all night
Wishing my life was not my life
I’m going down for real, down for real
他们说的太多 情绪再失控
现在只想逃离这里 做个白日梦
睁开眼睛我还是只想往外直冲
有一天黄皮肤也能踏进白宫
All the bygones they can be the bygones
Surrounded by fear now turn the lights on
I ain't got no option already been shut down
I’m going down for real
Ii can’t sleep I can’t sleep
Staying up all night
Wishing my life was not my life
I’m going down for real, down for real
Down down down down
Bygone Bygone
Down down down down
Bygone Bygone
