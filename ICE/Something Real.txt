Some day
All these people want someday
I don't really like the way this feel
All I wanted was something real
Some day
All these people want someday
I don't really like the way this feel
All I wanted was something real
Your love make me feel unreal
You said you will be ready someday
Just right now not someday
But I don't want to take control
Your love make me feel unreal
You said you will be ready someday
Just right now not someday
But I don't want to take control
我们活在这个虚无的世界
我们为何不能够更加直接
我的真心永远不会卖
远离这里一切
I'm fine
就算遍体鳞伤后溃败
我的精神意志
Never die
记住我的名字和对白
人们总是渴求着能够被爱
当他走后却再也没有回来
我看到你眼角的泪流下来
知道你内心有多么的无奈
