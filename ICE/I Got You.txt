
You know our love has nothing to do with the money
I'm sure you always got my back
Babe you are shining star so pretty
But I don't know how could be your sky
The world leave me I got you
I'm not alone
The world leave me I got you
I'm not alone
The world leave me alone I need to go go
If you still love me I wanna to know know
Let me taste your body feel like running cloudy
I don't wanna be alone can u make it to my home now
I only wanna see you make it never wanna leave
U know I love it when ur naked holding on to me
Irreplaceable and Ur the only one I need
So babe you should trust me
So babe you should trust me
So babe you should trust me
能将我融化的只有你
世界抛弃了我 我却拥有了你
