Up in the club takin’ shots to the face
Toast to the fact that we living better days
I got tears of joy, I just bought my folks a place
They told me not to do it, but I did it anyway

Paid vacays, flying home same day
We got different issues baby
we not on the same page, ay
did the album in New York, but dropped in LA
shout out 88 thats my family to the grave

There’s a shining light in you baby
Even though your point of view’s hazy
You’ve been ready to give up lately
But we all diamonds in the rough baby

There’s a shining light in you baby
Even though your point of view’s hazy
You’ve been ready to give up now lately
But we all diamonds in the rough yeah baby

I don't like to social
listen to my song and you be quiet
When you see my face on the wall
You were shocked but I feel normal
Everybody wears the mask I made
In da club in da room on da face
I just yawn you think I'm angry
I just draw my shirt you think is Burberry

I know I'm rich when we got the face
When you see my eyes deep like space
Sorry I'm not baby CEO
I just want like a baby say hello
I will enjoying when you feel lol
I want make you happy and happy for real (for real)
I want make you happy and happy for real
