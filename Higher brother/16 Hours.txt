I been in the game for a long time
 sixteen hours that’s a long flight
 You rob me you rob from the wrong guy
 she date me at the wrong time
 yeah hold on
 sixteen hours that’s a long flight
 you rob me you rob from the wrong guy
 She date me at the wrong time

 We don't do nothing wrong
 Over here James Mao
 我的钱包也很胖
 BBW where you from

 我不是乌鸦哥也不是耀洋哥
 Ladies follow my lead
 She take my breath
 She body like 黄金比例
 考验着我的体力

 No Name Studio B
 度过了无数个long night
 You still play toy we got hits boy
 I just do my thing that’s so nice

 My purple hair like lean in the cup
 让所有night club放刚出炉的歌
 当冰块掉进一杯可口的可乐
 简单暴力anything垂手可得

 Oh don't tell my mom
 I bought her a car
 Gotta whole lotta guap
 I can't get enough
 don't tell my mom
 I bought her a car
 Gotta whole lotta guap
 I can't get enough

 I been in the game for a long time
 sixteen hours that’s a long flight
 You rob me you rob from the wrong guy
 she date me at the wrong time
 yeah hold on
 sixteen hours that’s a long flight
 you rob me you rob from the wrong guy
 She date me at the wrong time

 five star rap star race car we are strangers
 speaking chinese eating white cheese
 hitting type beats
 旅行再一次

 dont worry about me
 overseas 都在talking about me
 talking about my ice talking about my vibe
 talking about my music
 You wanna fight with me I wanna twice

 任何事都没问题
 能用钱 解决掉的事情 都不叫问题
 红眼病 嫉妒心没人情才是你的问题
 I have dream fast cars sunshine 比基尼

 每天good morning 都在这个场景
 California海边有我不能说的秘密
 I loving my girl I look like a psycho
 she too loud my neighbor叫来了50

 take off my shoes take off my clothes
 take off my everything
 只为了填饱我肚子

 who I am Higher brothers wear icy chains
 你的feel谁在乎 钥匙装背带裤
 他们排队只为看我们show

 I been in the game for a long time
 Sixteen hours that’s a long flight
 You rob me you rob from the wrong guy
 She date me at the wrong time
 Yeah hold on
 Sixteen hours that’s a long flight
 You rob me you rob from the wrong guy
 She date me at the wrong time

 We don't see nothing wrong
 Over here James Mao

 BBW where you from
