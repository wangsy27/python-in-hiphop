
Whenever I take U into my life
It’s never too late to give U all my passion
We call it something different something wrong and something right
Woo
你不惧以前
意外难料难避免
我许不了你承诺但许你做我底线

傍晚落日的泛红柔焦在
瞳孔躺的陶白
一切都靠你眼神猜
Loewe Paula’s Ibiza 的味道like


I see nobody but U
I call it something right
I feel nobody but U
around the coastline and we run
I see nobody but U
I call it something wrong
I feel nobody but U but U but U wooo


Things may be bad
可我记得你的笑容

曝光过度的胶片
有你也不用挑选
只想把时光都和你消遣呐

I can't sleep all night
Argue with U只为了交代真实想法
U know I want ya
距离只是当下最烂的谎话

夏日限定般的告白
你总怀疑我的心里是不是会超载
脱口而出油腻的话不知道是被谁教坏
在我身边你可以放心做一个小孩

Hook:I see nobody but U
I called it something right
I feel nobody but U
Around the coastline and we run
I see nobody but U
I called it something wrong
I feel nobody but U but U but U wooo

I see nobody but U
I call it something right
I feel nobody but U
Around the coastline and we run
I see nobody but U
I call it something wrong
I feel nobody but U but U but U wooo
